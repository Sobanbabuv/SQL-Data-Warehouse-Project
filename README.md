# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Developed an end-to-end **Data Warehouse and analytics** solution leveraging SQL Server and Medallion Architecture framework (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). Implemented ETL pipelines to ingest raw data, perform data quality checks, and transform it into a structured schema with fact and dimension tables. Designed analytical queries and dahboards to deliver actionable business insights, showcasing skills in SQL, data modeling and enterprise data architecture.
